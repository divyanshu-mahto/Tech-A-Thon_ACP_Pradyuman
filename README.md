# Titanic Survival Prediction

Welcome to the Titanic Survival Prediction project! This repository contains code and resources for predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques.

---

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze historical passenger data from the infamous Titanic disaster and build predictive models to estimate the likelihood of survival for individuals given their characteristics. This is a classic machine learning problem and a popular beginner dataset for data science.

### Key Features

- **Data Analysis**: Explore and visualize the Titanic dataset to understand important factors affecting survival.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and process raw data for model training, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering.
- **Model Building**: Implement various machine learning models to predict survival, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods.
- **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC/AUC.
- **Deployment (optional)**: Code structure allows for easy extension to deploy predictions in apps or scripts.

## Project Structure

- **Python**: Used for data processing, analysis, and machine learning model implementation.
- **GDScript**: May be used for visualization, interactive apps, or extensions (such as Godot-based UI).

Typical directory structure:
```
Titanic-Survival-Prediction/
├── data/             # Raw and processed datasets
├── notebooks/        # Jupyter/IPython notebooks for exploration and prototyping
├── src/              # Source code for data processing and modeling
├── gdscript/         # Scripts and visualizations (if using Godot)
├── README.md         # Project documentation
└── requirements.txt  # Python dependencies
```

## How It Works

1. **Load Data**: The Titanic dataset, containing passenger information such as age, gender, class, and fare.
2. **Explore & Visualize**: Identify key factors affecting survival using plots and statistics.
3. **Preprocess Data**: Fill missing values, encode categories, engineer new features.
4. **Train Models**: Apply machine learning algorithms to learn patterns associated with survival.
5. **Test & Evaluate**: Use validation techniques to ensure model generalizability.
6. **Deploy/Use Predictions**: Optionally use the trained model to predict survival on new data.
